# drinks

Drinks I have deep experiences with. Very subjective so feel free to disagree.

## Wine

### White
- Francois Chidaine Les Bournais: Super tasty chenin blanc from the Loire valley. 
- Ramey Wine Cellars Chardonnay: Flavor explosion, very acidic and tasty, great fruit expression. Malolactic fermentation is buttery, but not overwhelming. Available in California Costco for $35. 
- Luis A. Rodriguez Vazquez _A Teixa Ribeiro_: Delicious, floral and creamy aromas with fresh fruit. Medium body and med+ flavor. $40.
- Jermann Where Dreams have no end: Such an artistic wine, amazing, sharp smells, and you can barely tell this is Chardonnay. ~$60.
- Chateau Montelena Chardonnay: Really ripe and rounded Chardonnay, not too buttery. ~$60.
- Jean-Claude Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru: The smells and flavor on this is crazy. ~$2500.

### Red

- La Rioja Alta Vina Alberdi: Great expression of Tempranillo for only $25.
- [Turley](https://www.turleywinecellars.com/): Their Zinfandel is amazing. Even their Juvenile, for around $25, is great. Their single vineyard wines are worth trying.
- [Odoardi: Giovan Battista (GB)](https://www.cantineodoardi.it/prodotto/gb-odoardi/): big, savory, oily wine that goes will with all tasty foods. Great expression of Southern Italy. ~$50.
- Merry Edwards Pinot Noir: Really loved how juicy and concentrated the fruits were. ~$60.
- Chateau de Nalys Chateauneuf-du-Pape: I like how fragrant, cocao, tobacco, slightly muted blueberry and blackberry, medium tingly, dancing tannins, long lasting mouth feel. It's very nice, not too big, and just makes me feel happy. Got for $67 at Costco, which is a steal.
- Caymus Cabernet: Crowd pleaser as well, but sewet, pine, wax, earth, mushroom, and stewed fruits. Excellent expression of Napa. ~$80.
- [Williams Selyem](https://www.williamsselyem.com/): Their Pinot is so gamey, wild, savory...it's really good. Wine making is very strong. Their Pinots start around $90.
- Château Smith Haut-Lafitte: Who doesn't like this classic from Graves, Pessac-Léognan? ~$125.
- Vice Versa: Great Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa. ~$160.
- Tignanello: Grippy tannins, full bodied fruit flavor. It's amazing wine, and yes it's mainstream. ~$180.
- Kongsgaard Cabernet: Wild, earthy, old vine flavor. Really liked the wine and just how interesting it is. ~$200.
- [Château Lafite Rothschild](https://www.lafite.com/domaines/chateau-lafite-rothschild/): The crowned big whig of all the wine world, and also mainstream. But this is what got me into wine, so I have to put it here. It's elegant, oily, and evolves with time, a classic to behold.
- [Promontory](https://www.promontory.wine/): Man this wine is incredible. I throw my hands up in disbelief what Mr. Harlan has created. ~$1000+.

### Other
- Dow's Vintage Port: ~$80.

## Sake

- [Toko Ginga Divine Droplets](https://www.vineconnections.com/japanese-sake/grades/junmai-daiginjo-daiginjo/divine-droplets/): Slightly sparkling, clean, fruity, floral -- serve chilled and it goes great with sushi and any lighter-flavored meal.
- Akabu Junmai Daiginjo "Gokujo no Kire": Wow this sake ROCKS. So fresh, so much flavor, so fruity...so much goodness. ~$165.

## Beer

- Kirin Ichiban: Seems like beer fanatics are not about this, but I like how crisp and clean this beer is.
- Flower Power from the Ithaca Beer Co: Unsure why I remember this so much and like it, but it's good.

## Whiskey

- Lagavulin 16 or the 11 Offerman Edition I like a lot. For me it's the perfect balance of sweet, peatiness, smoke and intensity. Obviously to each their own, but this is the one I can drink neat, with ice, or in a cocktail (whiskey sour preferred)
