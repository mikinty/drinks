Drinks I have deep experiences with. Very subjective so feel free to disagree.

## Wine

### White
- Francois Chidaine Les Bournais: Super tasty chenin blanc from the Loire valley. 
- Ramey Wine Cellars Chardonnay: Flavor explosion, very acidic and tasty, great fruit expression. Malolactic fermentation is buttery, but not overwhelming. Available in California Costco for $35. 
- Luis A. Rodriguez Vazquez _A Teixa Ribeiro_: Delicious, floral and creamy aromas with fresh fruit. Medium body and med+ flavor. $40.
- Jermann Where Dreams have no end: Such an artistic wine, amazing, sharp smells, and you can barely tell this is Chardonnay. ~$60.
- Chateau Montelena Chardonnay: Really ripe and rounded Chardonnay, not too buttery. ~$60.
- Jean-Claude Ramonet Montrachet Grand Cru: The smells and flavor on this is crazy. ~$2500.

### Red

- La Rioja Alta Vina Alberdi: Great expression of Tempranillo for only $25.
- [Odoardi: Giovan Battista (GB)](https://www.cantineodoardi.it/prodotto/gb-odoardi/): big, savory, oily wine that goes will with all tasty foods. Great expression of Southern Italy. ~$50.
- Merry Edwards Pinot Noir: Really loved how juicy and concentrated the fruits were. ~$60.
- Caymus Cabernet: Crowd pleaser as well, but sewet, pine, wax, earth, mushroom, and stewed fruits. Excellent expression of Napa. ~$80.
- Château Smith Haut-Lafitte: Who doesn't like this classic from Graves, Pessac-Léognan? ~$125.
- Vice Versa: Great Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa. ~$160.
- Tignanello: Grippy tannins, full bodied fruit flavor. It's amazing wine, and yes it's mainstream. ~$180.
- Kongsgaard Cabernet: Wild, earthy, old vine flavor. Really liked the wine and just how interesting it is. ~$200.
- [Château Lafite Rothschild](https://www.lafite.com/domaines/chateau-lafite-rothschild/): The crowned big whig of all the wine world, and also mainstream. But this is what got me into wine, so I have to put it here. It's elegant, oily, and evolves with time, a classic to behold.
- [Promontory](https://www.promontory.wine/): Man this wine is incredible. I throw my hands up in disbelief what Mr. Harlan has created. ~$1000+.

### Other
- Dow's Vintage Port: ~$80.

## Sake

- [Toko Ginga Divine Droplets](https://www.vineconnections.com/japanese-sake/grades/junmai-daiginjo-daiginjo/divine-droplets/): Slightly sparkling, clean, fruity, floral -- serve chilled and it goes great with sushi and any lighter-flavored meal.

## Beer

- Kirin Ichiban: Seems like beer fanatics are not about this, but I like how crisp and clean this beer is.
- Flower Power from the Ithaca Beer Co: Unsure why I remember this so much and like it, but it's good.
