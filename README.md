# drinks

Drinks I have deep experiences with. Very subjective so feel free to disagree.

## Wine

- Francois Chidaine Les Bournais: Super tasty chenin blanc from the Loire valley. 
- [Veuve Clicquot Brut Yellow Label]: I know this is mainstream, but I really like the high acidity, persistent bubbles, deep flavors of citrus and oak.
- Caymus Cabernet: Crowd pleaser as well, but sewet, pine, wax, earth, mushroom, and stewed fruits. Excellent expression of Napa.
- La Rioja Alta Vina Alberdi: Great expression of Tempranillo for only $25.
- Ramey Wine Cellars Chardonnay: Flavor explosion, very acidic and tasty, great fruit expression. Malolactic fermentation is buttery, but not overwhelming. Available in California Costco for $35.
- Luis A. Rodriguez Vazquez _A Teixa Ribeiro_: Delicious, floral and creamy aromas with fresh fruit. Medium body and med+ flavor. $40.
- [Odoardi: Giovan Battista (GB)](https://www.cantineodoardi.it/prodotto/gb-odoardi/): big, savory, oily wine that goes will with all tasty foods. Great expression of Southern Italy

## Sake

- [Toko Ginga Divine Droplets](https://www.vineconnections.com/japanese-sake/grades/junmai-daiginjo-daiginjo/divine-droplets/): Slightly sparkling, clean, fruity, floral -- serve chilled and it goes great with sushi and any lighter-flavored meal.

## Beer

- Kirin Ichiban: Seems like beer fanatics are not about this, but I like how crisp and clean this beer is.
