# My Bordeaux Tier List

There is the 1855 classification for Bordeaux that puts wines into 1st through 5th growths, but everyone has different tastes. Also some wines are getting prohibitively expensive, so I want to store my experiences as I may have only few chances at tasting each wine. Also, I will also rank any wines from Bordeaux, not just the 1855 classification ones, that I think deserve to have some sort of placement here.

Partly inspired by [Troy's Tasting Room's Bordeaux Tier list for 1st and 2nd growths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3x8YEblpw).


## S Tier

* Château Lafite Rothschild: An absolute crowd pleaser and the tertiary flavors and dried fruit flavors are so pleasant. So it's good in many facets but I cannot say it's amazing in all. But a very drinkable and enjoyable wine, for the beginner and the sophisticated.
* Château Lynch-Bages: Super smokey, complex, herbal. This is a fine cigar
* Château Smith Haut-Lafitte: Lots of stone and ripe fruits. 

## A Tier

* Château Langoa-Barton: Very strong and thick fruit along with complex tertiary flavors
* Château Ducru-Beaucaillou Croix de Beaucaillou (2nd wine): That classic seductive perfume smell, with roses and jammy blackberry and blueberry. On the tongue more oily texture and dried red fruits, medium+ finish and very tasty. Lingering med- sticky tannins.
* Château d'Armailhac: Seductive rose, bright strawberry, blackberry, blueberry (fresh). Sweet mushroom and pine, med+. Dry, med+ intensity, dusty tannins, mostly stewed strawberry and cherry, smoked, graphite flavor, very aromatic on back of throat after exhaling

## B Tier

* Château Canon-la-Gaffelière: Powerful wine 
* Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste: Too smoky and not enough fruit for me. But still an excellent wine
* Château Duhart-Milon: Pretty good Pauillac. Unmistakable sweet tobacco, slight smoke, earth, and lots of fruit. Tertiary a bit oily and almost truffle but just slightly. Not as fragrant as Lafite. On the palate, pretty light honestly. Not as tasty as the top Bordeaux wines, but still very good.
* Château Léoville Barton: Had the 2000 vintage in '25. Thought the wine was serious, tasty and silky. But for $200 it definitely feels overpriced. I'm surprised because Langoa-Barton feels like the tastier wine out of the two, although maybe you can argue Léoville Barton is more refined and serious?

## C Tier

* Château Smith Haut-Lafitte Le Petit Haut Lafitte: Very bold and big, fruits are not totally ripe but lots of blueberry and blackberry. There is strong graphite and the finish is med. very good wine especially for the price.
* Château La Gurgue: There is a lot of flavor in this wine. Very thick texture from oak, giving mushroom and wood and especially graphite notes. On the nose way less red fruit and a lot more black fruit. I do think it is a bit rough, eg very big but not precise and while good with food, as a standalone wine I think it is too rough to say it is a very good wine.
* Clos de la Cure: Semi ripe fruit, distinguished strawberry and cherry, more red fruits than darker ones, which are harder to pick out, besides blueberry. Some vanilla and cream from aging, a bit of some floral notes probably rose, and I wanna say there are some forest floor and slight herbal notes, but can't figure them out. On the palate, really dry but smooth ish tannins. Almost chewy because the tannins stick around for a while. Medium acidity and the finish is medium as well. Overall a very well produced wine!
* Chateau Poesia: Very fruity, not much oak, red and black fruits. Not much else but very fragrant and tasty.
* Chateau Gloria: 2016 vintage a bit tired. Started with strong aroma and strawberry and deep oak and dried dark fruits. But the flavor died out pretty quickly after an hour. (drank in 2024)

## Anything below here I probably won't list unless it was REALLY bad
